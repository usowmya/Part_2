Mobile Application nowadays have a great impact. Many new technologies have been incorporated in mobile phones and has been used by applications for different purposes. There are a lot of applications like maps, banking related.
I have listed below, two applications that I feel have  new features and are unique. They have attracted a lot of users and good ratings. 
First Application: WAZE
Link to application: [https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/waze-navigation-livetraffic/id323229106?mt=8]**
Description:
Waze is a global positioning system (GPS) based navigation app that allows users to report what they come across on the roads. [1] This includes the amount of traffic jams (slow moving or stand-still), travel time, accidents, speed traps, police cars, pot holes and much more. With an online map editor, one can update new routes, house numbers, landmarks, etc. It is described as a community- driven GPS navigation application.
The application works by collecting map data, traffic information and other reports from users and then transfers the real-time information to the Waze server at no cost through the internet on the phone of the user. Based on these information, Waze provides optimized routes, real time traffic and report updates. It also identifies fuel stations along the user’s route where the prices are low. With permission, it sends anonymous user information to its database to better their service.
Waze also has a voice navigation feature which can be turned on or off. Users are required to create/edit maps and update data continuously to help other users. Waze makes this interesting and competitive by providing a score board that allows you to compare yourself with your friend’s score on facebook (if you have synced your waze account with facebook). Waze also integrates with Foursquare, Facebook, etc. and notifies user when the driver driving through unsafe/high crime locations.

Why choose ‘Waze’ Application?
In my quest to identify novel apps on the store, the first app that came to my mind was 'Waze'. Though it is a navigation and maps app, there are a few things novel and unique about it. The app attracted so many users in a short time and Google acquired it for $1.3 billion (though they have their own maps app for a long time). One of the main unique features of Waze is the user reports based alerts. For example, users can report anything from a pothole on the road to an accident. The app uses reports from users in real time to update traffic information, animals killed on road, vehicle stopped on the shoulders, speed traps and much more [2] [3]. The UI is also designed for users to facilitate reporting events with few simple clicks on phone/tablet while driving. 
Uniqueness about the application:
•	The one very unique about this app is its social layer. Unlike most navigation apps on the store, Waze is an active community based app where in users share real-time traffic and road information, i.e., it gives you a heads-up about the reported obstacles on your route and then you can redirect your destination according to it.
•	It also captures the routes which users prefer to take towards their frequent destinations, while it finds the cheapest gas station alone the route.
•	The users also have given a hands-free voice control to report information which is activated when you wave your hand in front of your mobile screen
•	(uses phone’s proximity sensor). Using prompts like “report traffic”, the app provides alerts on traffic flows.
•	Waze’s interesting features are its social and gamification features. Wazers (users) can earn points whenever they contribute road information, and points gets higher, according to their ranking in the Waze community rises from Waze baby to Waze royalty.
•	Users are also given options to contribute by editing Waze’s maps to fix errors which they encounter on their way. The more the user drives and edits, higher is their rank as a Waze editor and the permissions given expands [4].
•	It also avoids the need of informing your friends that you are two-minutes away texts, because users can see live status of their friends and collogues who uses Waze as they travel towards the destination spot. It uses Facebook integration for this who have kept please respond automatically in the app.

Technologies:
•	Algorithms which turns GPS traces into maps.
•	Crowd sourced map editing
Technologies That Are Leverage:
•	Developer: Google maps, google cloud messaging, android wear SDK
•	Marketing: MailChimp, google admob,google tag manager
•	Product & Design: Google Fonts
•	Analytics: Google Analytics
•	Productivity: G Suite, Google Drive
•	Customer support and success: Google forms,phpBB

ADVANTAGES:
•	In waze, we save a lot of time and money by having the largest network of drivers who work together to outwit the traffic.
•	We get a continuous recommends of the fastest routes based on real-time driving given by millions of users.
•	It is the most comprehensive driving companions in the marketplace where it offers traffic reroutes to low gas alerts and offers from favorite brands
•	When the users are more in number who provides more data, and therefore better looking maps and it inturn attracts new wazers. This has a positive network of virtuous cycle.
•	It captures value by displaying location based ads for business purposes such as restaurants and stores. The application totally relies on the power of community.

DISADVANTAGES:
•	One of the largest complaints about Waze is the ugly and cluttered layout of the maps. In an area with little activity or users, the app loses its community advantage over Google Maps. But, in areas with a large community, the number of icons on the screen can be overwhelming.
•	Waze displays maps with other users, hazards, traffics jams, police traps, accidents, and much more; a tiny mobile screen can quickly become filled and make it difficult for users to find their routes.
•	Furthermore, the app can be distracting. Friends appear, accumulating points ding, ads pop, routes are re-routed, and drive-by incidents beg to be reported. Laws against distracted driving should encourage users to put their phones down when driving, but we all know how difficult it is to ignore a beeping phone.
•	Lately, police offices across the country have begun to take issue with Waze’s police reporting feature. Police argue that alerting other drivers to police traps and police presence are making targets of police officers. Waze disagrees, arguing that the police reporting feature of the app increases driver safety because users drive more carefully when in the presence of police.
•	Another complaint that users have against Waze is the amount of battery power and data resources it consumes. While battery drain is comparable to battery drain while using Google Maps, remember, the app is still reporting data to Waze even when it’s not navigating. This means that the phone uses its charge at a higher rate while the app is running in the background which is much higher than Google Maps’. For Waze users, having a car charger is essential.

IMPROVISATION:
Waze is a application, where it is used in today’s generation as they are getting exactly what they want through the internet. Even though it drains battery, data, and cluttered screen, the application helps the driver to save time. It would be good if we incorporate for bikes and cycles, because the government has now started the task in creating bike lanes and infrastructures for cyclists so it would be useful.  
First Heuristic Evaluation
 Visibility of system status: This application has a clear visibility of status, where user is being notified about each step and navigates the destination and reroutes them if it encounters any reports by informing the users. It also gives you notification to the user about the offers about your favorite store and cheap gas station.
Second Heuristic Evaluation
Help and documentation: This application has rich help documents and has videos also to help the user to know how to proceed with the next step correctly. When you go to setting in this application and there is a tab for help under that you have documents and videos which is useful for the users.
Second Application: [DUOLINGO]
Link to application: [https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/duolingo-learn-languages-for/id570060128?mt=8]


DESCRIPTION
Duolingo is one of the simple application to learn different languages from the beginning [5]. It is not just a stand-alone language course but a language learner’s toolbox. It sets up your daily tasks according to your settings. It’s easy and fun to use it. We have 23 languages in this application. First you need to select the language which you want to learn, it gives you module based lessons. When you complete one module the next module gets activated. It allows you to test your skills. There is also a feature where a new vocabulary is often taught with images, grammar points explained in speech bubbles. You also have listening tasks where to listen and type what you hear. It has a new “hearts” system, which loses life when you answer it wrong. It also has a progress bar to check our progress.
Uniqueness about the application:
•	It has tips which pops in between the modules which is very useful for the users to learn that language well.
•	It also has a notes section for grammars for the language which your learning.
•	Duolingo has a voice tasks wherein you must listen to the phrase or a sentence and then answer them, which is very useful to get the pronunciation of that language for the users.

ADVANTAGES [6]
•	You have an option of getting costumes for your duo.
•	You have an option of finishing the lessons at speed according to our wish.
•	It is very simple to use and more organized.
•	It has flash cards and images as an add-ons.
•	This app has a feature to earn lingots by maintaining full hearts throughout a lesson.
•	It has a group of community where you can practice.
DISADVANTAGES [7]
•	Duolingo does not support in terms of grammar, where grammar plays a major role in learning a language. It would be good if they incorporate this alone with the vocabulary.
•	They use words which you likely won’t use in your everyday life (“the donkey eats the grass”) when it comes to complex structures. But for beginners who start learning from this app it would be great at the start.
•	They have the listening exercise, where the sentences are spoken is not in a native way of speaking that language. It only provides machine way of speaking that language.
•	The web version has more tips than in mobile application.

Technologies That Are Leveraged [8]:
•	Sales and support: Zendesk, Qualtrics research suite.
•	Marketing: Google apps for work, Mailchimp, Segment, Amazon SES
•	HR: CloudFactory, Dribbble Jobs,Lever
•	Analytics: Google Analytics, Mixpanel
•	Finance and Accounting: Stripe,Braintree Payments 

IMPROVISATION:
Duolingo is a wonderful language learning application by itself, but I personally feel if it has a voice recording feature in this wherein if you record your voice and check for the pronunciation. If we learn an application and practice by speaking to someone else or by checking our voice.

First Heuristic Evaluation: 
Visibility of system status 

This application always keeps the user informed about his action. If the user wants to examine his skill by attending the quiz, he gets feedback according to his input given. The time taken for the response to get from the system is very minimal.

Second Heuristic Evaluation:
Help and documentation
There is no such thing called help or support in this application. For any application it is very important for it to have a customer support tab or a live chat. If the user is held with some problem, at that time it would be convenient for the user to solve the issue. Now that if any issues the user gets he is forced to go to the web application and get the information which is not very user friendly.
